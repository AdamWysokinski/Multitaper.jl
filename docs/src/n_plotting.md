# [Examples](@id Examples)

There are a number of [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) noteboooks
in the Examples directory. The simplest way to run these may be to first instantiate
the project folder in Examples using

```@julia
(v1.0) pkg> activate .
(Examples) pkg> instantiate
>julia include("run_notebooks.jl")
```

This will open a browser window containing the notebooks, where you can run them.
