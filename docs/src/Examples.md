# Examples

There are a number of IJulia.jl noteboooks in the Examples directory. The simplest way
to run these may be to first instantiate the project folder in Examples using

```
(v1.0) pkg> activate .
(Examples) pkg> instantiate
include("run_notebooks.jl")
```

You will need a working installation of IJulia.jl.
