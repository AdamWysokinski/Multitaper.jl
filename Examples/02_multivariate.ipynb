    "A standard tool for decomposing the cross-correlation between two time series in terms of frequency is the magnitude squared coherence and its accompanying phase. Magnitude squared coherence, if computed naively without smoothing, results in an estimate that is everywhere exactly unity. The multitaper analogue of magnitued squared coherence, outlined in Thomson and Chave (1991) show that jackknifing over cross-spectral estimates is an indispensable tool for producing magnitude squared coherences that do not require smoothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we'll be examining the magnitude squared coherence and phase of a multivariate series, as well as coherences and transfer functions. Example 1.5 from the freely available text by Shumway and Stoffer ed 4., is used here. \n",

    "> The SOI and recruitment time series show \"monthly values of an environmental series called the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and associated Recruitment (number of new fish) furnished by Dr. Roy Mendelssohn of the Pacific Environmental Fisheries Group (personal communication). Both series are for a period of 453 months ranging over the years 1950â€“1987.\""
